        "Suppose you want to make a vision model to implement Animal control in your college. There are jungles around so you want your models to be aware of all species. Your model needs to generate a warning if you see a dangerous animals. However, if features like Whiskers, etc. are spotted, you need to incorporate the idea that seeing a Lion is much less probable than seeing a similar looking cat, and have a more reasonable classifier. This sort of feature extraction and probabilistic reasoning with an ensemble of classifiers is partially Bayesian, and holds great promise in both research and industry."
