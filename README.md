## Introduction

The **Fundamental Modern Machine Learning Lab** is designed to provide hands-on experience with key concepts and techniques in machine learning. Throughout this lab, you'll explore various algorithms, models, and tools that are essential in the field of machine learning.

## Lab Structure

The lab is structured into several sessions, each focusing on a specific aspect of machine learning. The topics include:

1. **Introduction to Machine Learning**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Supervised Learning**
4. **Unsupervised Learning**
5. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**
6. **Deep Learning Basics**
7. **Advanced Topics (e.g., Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing)**

Each session will have its own folder containing:

- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file with the lab exercises.
- A PDF or markdown file with the theoretical background.
- Sample datasets for hands-on practice.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this lab, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability).
- Familiarity with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fmml-lab.git
   cd fmml-lab
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
